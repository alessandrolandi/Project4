# path-finder

The puzzle uses an array of positive integers. The objective is to find a path from index zero to the last index in the array. At each step we need to know the distance to be traveled and the direction. Each entry in the array is a number indicating the distance to be traveled on this particular leg of the path. The player (your program) needs to decide the direction (if the move should be made to the right or to the left). The puzzles can have more than one solution. This program finds and prints all of the solutions given the objective.
